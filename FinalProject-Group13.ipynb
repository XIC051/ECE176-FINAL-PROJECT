    "Mobile applications have become an essential part of daily life, catering to various user needs ranging from entertainment to productivity. Both the genre and the content rating of an app are crucial attributes that can determine its reception among users, which can be measured by the number of reviews and user ratings it receives[^Khalid2015].\n",
    "\n",
    "There have been several studies analyzing aspects of mobile applications and their performance in the market. In a study by Mo et al. (2017), they examined the relationship between the number of downloads, ratings, and the category of Android apps. They discovered that different app categories had varied ratings, and this variance significantly influenced the number of download[^Mo2017].\n",

    "In a different study, Fu et al. (2013) analyzed the impact of age ratings on the success of iOS games, and they found that games rated for older age groups had fewer downloads but higher revenues[^Fu2013]. While these studies have looked at genre or content rating separately, our research will extend this line of inquiry by investigating how these two factors together influence an app's reviews and ratings.\n",

    "Other relevant research includes a study by Khalid et al. (2015), where they investigated the common reasons behind negative app reviews. They found that bugs, app functionality, and customer service were significant factors that led to lower ratings[^Khalid2015]. This background could provide valuable context in understanding the dynamics of user reviews and ratings.\n",

    "In this project, ethics and privacy are critical and is one of our major concerns. The proposed data potentially includes sensitive information such as user reviews and ratings. Biases might arised from the collection of usage of such data, potentially leaking sensitive information or leads to biased result of our project. For example, the app reviews data might exclude certain populations based on the various contents of the app, and the potential customers of each app differ by a large scale, which can lead to the uncomprehensive result and unfair or discriminatory analysis. To prevent such problems, it is important to conduct a thorough review of the dataset before analysis, identify any biases, and take actions to mitigate them. During our analysis, we must remain vigilant for biases and evaluate the impact of any findings on different demographic and different age groups. Afterward, when discussing the analysis, transparency about the dataset's limitations should also be maintained and keep in mind for responsible and ethical approach. Furthermore, in order to be thorough, the misuse of user data for targeted advertising without explicit consent could infrige upon user privacy. In order to handle it, it is necessary to anonymize and aggregfate the data, use dataset from public source that has user consent for data usage, and ensure compliance with any privacy regulations. In summary, ethics and privacy are essential to data scientists. Addressing concerns, mitigating biases, protecting privacy, and complying with ethics are significant during the data collection, analysis, and communication processes. Transparency, fairness, and responsible data handling are important to ensure an unbiased and ethical project."
